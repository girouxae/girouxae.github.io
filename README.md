### Hello, World!


### This portfolio is under construction. Thank you for your patience! 


____


#### While this portfolio is under construction, I am going to include some goals and learning notes. 



##### Current goals: 

- Create a new ePortfolio

- Learn about Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages

- Be able to easily share information about myself and my qualifications


##### Current learning notes:

- Working on building my Pages site locally. I've realized the instructions for getting Ruby, Bundler, Jekyll etc. feel very circular. Once I better understand the process, I'd like to help with clarity and potentially make a pull request.
