### Hello, World!


### This portfolio is under construction. Thank you for your patience! 


____


#### While this portfolio is under construction, I am going to include some goals and learning notes. 



##### Current goals: 

- Create a new ePortfolio

- Learn about Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages

- Be able to easily share information about myself and my qualifications


##### Current learning notes:

- I have Jekyll working in Windows and am working on creating pages locally. It took a bit to find the one line I was missing in the local build process, but it finally works! This means actual content coming soon!
